-- Launcher auto-update: does the release THIS repo publishes satisfy the
-- contract the launcher actually reads?
--
-- Run from the mod directory, or from anywhere:
--
--   lua tests/launcher_update_test.lua [path/to/gen1recomp]
--
-- The engine can also come from GEN1RECOMP_ROOT.  Same discovery rules as the
-- other suites in this directory.
--
-- ------- what this file is for
--
-- Everything else in tests/ is about the mod at runtime -- what portrait a
-- speaker gets.  This one is about the other half of shipping a mod: whether
-- the launcher will offer an update for it, and whether the archive it would
-- download is the one sitting in this repo.
--
-- The chain, all of it in the engine's own code:
--
--   manifest.json  ->  "github": "owner/repo"   (src/mods/Manifest.parseGithub)
--   RomImporter:_syncModUpdateInfo  ->  GET api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases
--   ModUpdate.parseRelease          ->  semver tag + a .zip asset
--   ModUpdate.pickZipAsset          ->  prefers "<mod-id>-<version>.zip"
--   ModUpdate.statusFor             ->  "available" only if strictly newer
--   RomImporter:_modGithubAction    ->  the Update button, then the download
--
-- Each of those is asserted here against a synthetic release built to look
-- exactly like the one this repo publishes -- same tag shape, same asset
-- names, same extra assets.  The point is not that the parser works in
-- general; it is that THIS repo's shape is one the parser accepts.  A release
-- whose asset is named slightly differently, or whose tag is not semver, is
-- silently invisible in the launcher, and that failure mode is what this
-- suite exists to catch.
--
-- Nothing here touches the network.  parseReleases / pickZipAsset / statusFor
-- are pure, and they are where every one of those silent failures lives.

-- an entry it cannot use is DROPPED -- no error, no reason, just a list
-- without it.  A mod whose only release is unusable therefore looks perfectly
-- up to date, which is the failure nobody notices.
--
-- The single-object branch (`/releases/latest`) is the one that answers with a
-- reason, and that reason is what the Update button puts on screen.
